  <h1>git tutorial</h1>
  <p>Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development for tracking changes in source code during the development process. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently by providing features such as branching, merging, and version history tracking. With Git, developers can work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. It offers a decentralized architecture, enabling developers to work offline and sync their changes with remote repositories when they have internet access. Additionally, Git provides robust mechanisms for resolving conflicts that may arise when merging changes from different branches. Overall, Git revolutionizes the way teams manage and collaborate on software projects, enhancing productivity and ensuring the integrity of codebases.</p>
